# About Me

Here are some facts. As the new year dawns, in January of 2021, I am a 38 year old human undergoing a physical relocation of my family from Tucson, AZ to Brunswick, ME, while working remotely on web application development for the University of Arizona.

Why did I begin coding? I was into my thirties, working as a bartender, almost a decade had passed after having attained a BA Liberal Arts, and I began learning how.
