# About Me

I am a 38 year old developer, transitioning to Brunswick, ME from Tucson, AZ. I'm currently working at the University of Arizona (remotely).

I started learning to code when I was 12 or 13; if you do the math that's 1996ish. After a short stint taking technical support calls for my father's company &mdash; an early ISP in VT called SoverNet &mdash; I decided computers were not interesting, and put the whole thing down for around 20 years.

Which brings me to the summer of 2017 &mdash; realizing I'd obviously been using computers for the last 20 years anyways, for so many things, like music, writing, communication, work, education, and entertainment &mdash; the woman who would become my wife sent me a link for a coding bootcamp and encouraged me to consider it. I shortly decided enroll, and from that moment forward, I have been creating for the web.

I was hired for my first dev job at Simpleview starting one month prior to the end of the 6 month long bootcamp. Since then, now in my second job, I've balanced full time development work with family, music, and active side-projects amd side-work to advance my aptitude and experience as a developer.
