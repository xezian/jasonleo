Long ago I rambled

There was a time once, and I know many of us to remember it well.

Things were different in the before time. I mean, different but not also similar. Before what you ask, but you already know. Before the year 2020. Before the pandemic, and the panic, and the pivot.

The last supper was on our new dining room table. Wood, already long, with two leaves to make it longer. We dined fearlessly with our friends, on tortilla soup and wine, and discussed the virus that was beginning to show up in the news.

But lets go further back, to the dawn of not quite adulthood, to the mystic moment in 1999 with sunlight breaking into prisms and laughter and harmonic overtones, feeling everything but knowing nothing, especially not how little I knew.

But not even only that, but from much earlier still, stumbling through leaves in the park after chubby city squirres at the ankles of my young parents, and everything in between those times. What have all these moments taught me. In the before time, wiht a certain water colored quality swirled into everything, I am not sure what the surface is made of, between those places, impermeable but in the one direction, forward. Why are we like water?
