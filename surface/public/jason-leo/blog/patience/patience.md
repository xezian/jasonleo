# Patience

    I believe it is time for patience today.

    Looking outward, while on an inward pursuit

    was never supposed to be easy, was never

    a trick, or a joke, or anyone's idea of a life.

    So what next? Platitudes. The heartbeat of a snail.

    The sharp ongoing whistle pitch that only some of us

    can hear. Manifold candlewax, laxative plastic, ragtag lollygagger

    on the loose. It's not the truth. The fruits of a new scrutiny.

    Field me. Observe a small smooth place of peace in the field.

    That is not real, but it is not lost on me. I felt the soft cost of

    such loss, and leaves of grief fell around these feet forever.
