I read a Twitter post earlier about someone having to debug a homespun csv parser that's just `str.split()` and well. That's something I know I need to work on here. One of the initial things I was advised was like "put it out there, make it work however, whatever means, then go back and refactor". I think it's good advice but we cannot ignore the refactoring bit.

This is not so far a tech blog, but I can't promise it will not include tech content. I want to be able to organize these logically, and this got me thinking.

I will write a blog post about how I take this "personal" blog, and extend it into also a techblog.

These are my first thoughts about it. What I am doing here so far is more like a journal. I have tagged them as personal. So I could tag the others as tech, and allow filtering. Or I could make multiple blogs, using directories, and read them into different pages entirely. But then I cannot tag a post as personal and tech at the same time.

But I like the directories. This blog is set up read content from the `public/jason-leo` directory. It would be nice if things were orgainzed and logical for me when I'm writing for the blog (or updating projects, or about as they work similarly)

I'll have to make a decision, but first things first. Let's outline the things that are needed for this:

- Implement a more reliable csv parser than the one I made myself with `str.split()`.
- Organize posts by tags and directories
