Tomorrow!

Tomorrow will soon be today. Tomorrow (and tomorrow's tomorrow) I will be doing more than a few things. And boy do I like to write lists of the things I intend to do. So here is tomorrow's list for your enjoyment:

1. Work a full day! I have a job.
2. Replace the handle and valve on the bathtub (someone is coming over to help me)
3. Sand and repaint damaged parts of a door
4. Borrow a truck from a friend, to use to remove debris and possibly later pick up a washing machine.
5. Cook 3 meals and clean up after.
6. Get a grinder with a cutting wheel.
7. Talk to a loan officer about a mortgage.
8. Water many plants outside.

There's a much longer list too, with everything that needs to be done before the end of this month, but I won't get into that here. It is the list of a person in the middle of moving, with a lot of things up in the air at once.

I used to draw a lot of pictures. Things change as time passes. I wrote more songs once too, but I'm determined to restore the practice. Life is a meandering path. I never expected to be where I am, and doing this now. I never knew where I was headed. But that's okay. That's not the issue.

I am a product of the liberal arts education. Take it or leave it, love it or hate it, it is what it is. They said it would open doors, and they said not to worry. I thought what doors? There never were any. What use are doors in a room without walls?

Things come together in the end, one way or another. I'm really full of it today. Lots of little somethings. I miss the way we used to feel, but I'm not afraid of what I have become.
