# Reporting on the fragment, from an incomplete perspective

Being as we find ourselves, as only a part of what we actually are, it just so happens upon us to uncork the mental seal of thinking otherwise. This is something I am really on about but unable to articulate. Not clever enough. Not actionable enough. Some filiment of something woven, and entirely vaster than I was ever even in on, is what must be the case. Space. Outer space, open space, empty space. The creases of the folds of the hard wrought yet somehow also liquid stone along the coast. Where some breath of a song of a rhythm of a dance acts and splashes and plays and surrenders everything in repeated meaningless geestures into the unknown enternally. When certainty learned of a kind of purposeful refurnishing returns wordless and swerves absurd, the veheicle exhausts, the hand reaches, solemnly into the void, for a way through, as often as stop motion, platonic, static, non-vocal, and beholden. I fold into the mold, like cold dough, like the slow flow of glass panels over oceans alone. I sound somehow unfounded, boundless, and drowning, but in the real house I make meals and sounds and somehow keep sweetness around. All in now, standing ground, circled around is how we found ourselves, resoundingly loud.
