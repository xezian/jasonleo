# This Time

I know you know what I mean, when I say this, on July 20th of 2020. I'm writing from the planet Earth. I could be anywhere at this time on the planet Earth going probably a good ways into the future, and the words "This Time" will be enough for you to know what I mean. Like "how did we get here?" or "with everything going on...", these snips of phrase, common adages they may be, have taken on a new level of meaning in the current state of things. This time. You see I can't not do it. Double negatives squared. There's no place like home.

I recently wrote a song. I mean, it seems recent, but really it was months ago. Of course, it was sometime since March. I wrote a song and the first several lyrics of it are like this:

> "Help me to understand, what the world has come to."

That's really enough. I wrote all the rest of this songs lyrics, and told myself how I would most certainly be writing another soon, but it hasn't happened yet. Looking back, I can see the problem in the first words. It's probably an unreasonable request. There are probably reasons for this, but I will almost certainly fail to explain them.

Let me talk to you instead about the coronavirus test swab, as a way of deliberately changing the subject without actually steering away from the issue. Although this is only half true, because as big as it feels, and as intertwined as they have become, the novel coronavirus is not the whole thing. There's another thing, or probably a few other things, but in some ways it feels like just one big ugly nest of weirdness so yeah I guess that's not an easy topic to talk about.

So I got in line with my family in a hot parking lot yesterday morning, and sweated and waited for our turn.

Maybe you're wondering why we're here, but probably not. It probably sounds like we're lucky, and it is. This is a really nice place to be right now. It's where I grew up, and where my childhood family lives. I don't know of another term for it. By 'childhood family' I mean my mom, my dad, my sister, and I guess that's it. Family is a big word, but I guess when I say 'my family' I'm usually talking about my wife, and my son. My wife and I came here from five days away by car, picking up my son in a city about halfway, and that's actually a bit more of a story but whatever it's how we got here.

Things are extra weird in this time.

I'm not really sure how to feel about anything. The sun was really hot in the parking lot. I told you how we came from five days away, well also you should know we came from a place notoriously hotter than this. And yet, yesterday morning, in line to be tested outdoors in a parking lot, all three of us were sweating.

There were lots of people in the line. More people than any of us have been around in one place since before this time. This was a Covid-19 test site for people without symptoms. This is not an option in most of America. Again, we are lucky. Still everyone was wearing a mask, and the closer the line got to the end, where the tests were being conducted, well, the more obvious it became that it's not a very pleasant experience. Just before it was our turn, a young boy began screaming very loudly, repeatedly. Members of the boy's family stood around him to hold his head still while he wailed and was eventually swabbed. Immediately afterward he took off running. And then it was our turn.

My wife and I have been extremely careful since March. This has truly and profoundly changed our lives, and despite truly wishing for a complete return to the normalcy of 'The Before Time' (name of next post maybe?), it's beginning to feel as if we've accepted that we wont. Maybe that's okay. I mean it kind of has to be, seeing as it's completely out of our control. I remember hearing the phrase "life's not fair" pretty often as a child, and I've noticed myself saying it to children as an adult. So we have to go on with our unfair lives. Learn to appreciate the state of things, try and adjust our position. We have to try and find a comfortable enough way of sitting like on an airplane or a bus seat, and just ride it out.

My son was the first of us to be tested. He was also the most nervous but he wanted to get it over with so we let him go first. I was last. The test was quick and painless, but it definitely feels weird to have a feathery tipped stick wiggled about that far inside your nose. They warned us that it would make our eyes tear up and it did. So now we await results.
