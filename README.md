# [Jason Leo](https://www.jasonleo.dev)

Hey, hi!

I am Jason Leo, and this is the repository where I am building jasonleo.dev, my new personal website and blog. This will be Serverless via AWS, using a cloudfront distribution of an s3 bucket, running a Vue app, that accesses some resources from another s3 bucket.

Setup locally with `npm install` and run with `npm run dev`

[The `surface` directory](/surface) contains the Vue application.
